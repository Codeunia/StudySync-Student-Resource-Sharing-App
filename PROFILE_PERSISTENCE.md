# Profile Data Persistence - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 🔄 **Data Loading**

- Profile data (name, role, institution, graduation year, skills, photo) is loaded from JSON Server on component mount
- Falls back to default values if server is not running or user doesn't exist
- Automatic user creation if user doesn't exist in database

### 💾 **Data Saving**

Profile data is automatically saved to JSON Server when:

1. **Edit Toggle**: When user finishes editing basic info (name, username, role)
2. **Institution Change**: When institution input loses focus (`onBlur`)
3. **Graduation Year**: Immediately when graduation year is selected
4. **Skills Management**: When skills are added or removed
5. **Photo Upload**: When a new profile photo is uploaded
6. **Auto-Save**: Debounced auto-save (1 second delay) when any profile field changes

### 🛡️ **Error Handling**

- Graceful degradation when JSON Server is not running
- Console warnings when saves fail
- Fallback to local state if API calls fail

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **API Functions Used**

- `usersAPI.getByUsername()` - Load user profile
- `usersAPI.create()` - Create new user
- `usersAPI.update()` - Update existing user profile

### **Key Functions Added**

- `saveUserProfile()` - Main function to save profile data
- Enhanced `loadData()` - Now loads user profile along with posts/resources
- Updated event handlers for all profile fields

### **Data Structure**

```json
{
	"id": 1,
	"fullName": "User Name",
	"username": "username",
	"role": "Student|Working Professional",
	"institution": "Institution Name",
	"graduatingYear": "2027",
	"skills": ["JavaScript", "React"],
	"photo": "base64_image_data",
	"followers": ["user1", "user2"]
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Test 1: Basic Profile Editing**

1. Start JSON Server: `npm run json-server`
2. Start app: `npm run dev`
3. Click edit button on profile
4. Change name, username, role
5. Click save (checkmark icon)
6. Refresh page - changes should persist

### **Test 2: Institution & Graduation Year**

1. Change institution name
2. Click outside input (onBlur triggers save)
3. Change graduation year from dropdown
4. Refresh page - changes should persist

### **Test 3: Skills Management**

1. Click "Edit" on skills section
2. Add new skills
3. Remove existing skills
4. Click "Save"
5. Refresh page - skills should persist

### **Test 4: Photo Upload**

1. Upload a profile photo
2. Photo should display immediately
3. Refresh page - photo should persist

### **Test 5: Server Down Scenario**

1. Stop JSON Server
2. Make profile changes
3. Should see warning message
4. Changes work locally but don't persist
5. Start server and refresh - original data loads

## ⚡ **Performance Optimizations**

### **Debounced Saves**

- Auto-save has 1-second debounce to prevent excessive API calls
- Immediate saves for user-triggered actions (button clicks, dropdown changes)

### **Error Recovery**

- Failed saves don't break the UI
- Console warnings for debugging
- Automatic fallback to local state

## 🚀 **Benefits**

### **For Users**

- ✅ No data loss on page refresh
- ✅ Seamless editing experience
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback
- ✅ Works offline (with limitations)

### **For Developers**

- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Robust error handling
- ✅ Easy to extend for new fields
- ✅ Consistent API patterns

## 📝 **Future Enhancements**

1. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, sync with server in background
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous edits from multiple devices
3. **Image Optimization**: Compress uploaded photos before saving
4. **Validation**: Add form validation before saving
5. **Undo/Redo**: Allow users to undo profile changes
